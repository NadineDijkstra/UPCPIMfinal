Analysis code for the paper "No overlap between unconscious and imagined representations" by Nadine Dijkstra, Simon van Gaal, Linda Geerligs, Sander Bosch & Marcel van Gerven. Preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/ctdmk/

'MasterWrapper.m' walks through all analysis steps from raw data to main results. Requires SPM, Fieldtrip and Freesurfer to be installed and communicating with MATLAB. 

Raw data can be downloaded from: https://doi.org/10.34973/j9yn-q419. This contains all functional scans already realigned, coregistered and normalised to MNI space via DARTEL normalisation (more details in the analysis code and paper).
